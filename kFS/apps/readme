Creating a kFS app:

Make a directory. In it, place a makefile, a fsw/src folder,
and whatever files you need for the app to run.

The main file will house the app runloop (preferrably it 
doesnâ€™t loop). It will execute in accordance with the 
scheduler, which can call main and pass it certain arguments 
to tell it what it should do.
- unless there no function overloading
The command dictionary will assign a number to a given
call configuration, and execute the call.

The app makefile will compile all of the source files and 
place them (along with tables and other files) inside the 
build/cpu1/exe directory.

Be sure to add your app's makefile to apps/make.ks and to
put the compiling info in apps/build.ks.

And make sure that there's an associated command for it 
in schedule.json and the command dictionary.
