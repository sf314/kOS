Creating a kFS app:

Make a directory. In it, place a makefile, a fsw/src folder,
and whatever tables you need for the app to run.

1:
The main file of the app will really be a series of 
functions that the scheduler can call.

2:
The main file will house the app runloop. It will execute 
in accordance with the scheduler, which can call main and 
pass it certain arguments to tell it what it should do.
- unless there no function overloading
The command dictionary will assign a number to a given
call configuration, and execute the call
