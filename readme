How to use the scripts in this folder in KSP

Make sure that the boot.ks file is set as 
you boot script in VAB.

Upon loading your craft, the CPU will boot 
and the boot.ks file will run. It will:
- search the archive for files titled using
  craftName.update and run it if it exists
- search the archive for files titled using 
  craftName.boot and run it if it exists
- wait 10 seconds and reboot, to search again

Update scripts are used when your craft is 
in a mission and you wish for it to execute
new instructions. Load the scene containting
your craft in order to do so. *Craft 
requires connection to KSC.

Boot scripts are used when your craft is 
initially loaded onto the launchpad and
ready to begin its first script. This 
would usually be a launch script unless it
is a rover detaching from its parent craft.

// *** Standardized functions and files:
These files will be loaded onto the vessel
by default, so you can run them anytime.
